# Train-Reservation-System

This project was made during a Data Managment class at Rutgers University. 
This project allowed customers to reserve train tickets and monitor train 
schedules. The database behind the project used MYSQL to store customer 
information and track the status of reservations. The front end of the 
website used JSP and CSS.
